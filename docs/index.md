###Game Mode

Game mode currently can only grab the pixel information for games in windowed mode due to how DirectX handles full-screen rendering.  To enjoy your games as if they were in full-screen mode check out [this piece of software](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming).

##System Design

A basic overview of the system design will be available shortly.

##Developing an Extension
